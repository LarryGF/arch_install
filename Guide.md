# The Arch Linux installation guide for the unlucky noob with limited connectivity

First of all, let me begin by saying that, of all the distros that I've tried, Arch is my favorite one by far (and believe me, I've tried a lot: Debian, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, mostly every Manjaro flavour out there, Linux Mint...). It's highly customizable, it's bleeding-edge (meaning that you'll have access to the latest packages with little to no delay), it has a very granular installation process, an extremely efficient and functional package manager, and, what's probably my favorite feature (albeit not being an inherent feature of the distro): "The Arch Wiki", if you have a problem, chances are you're gonna find the solution in the wiki, or at least get a hint as to what you can do to solve it (bonus points for being available as a package too, but more on that in a while).
Having said that, even as I strongly recommend it as a day-to-day distro, I wouldn't recommend to use it for your production servers unless you're a person that really enjoys the thrill of knowing that your production servers can crash and burn at any moment if you're not careful.

## Reason of this walkthrough

I'm not gonna lie, if you have little to no experience with Linux, Arch will be a handful, well, to be honest, even people that have experience with other Linux distributions will sometimes get frustrated with Arch, but don't worry, usually that frustration fades away in a couple weeks and turns into worship :laughing:. To be fair, the hardest part for people that are new to Arch is the installation process, after that, everything is very similar to most modern Linux distributions. Because of that ,I've argued with my colleagues several times over the years over the practicality of encouraging people that are new to Linux to start using Arch Linux as their first distribution. Although I think that: "you can't punish a person that has no clue about Linux by forcing them to install a distro that goes out of its way to make things hard for newbies" is a valid point, I also think that if you manage to pull through on the first weeks, get your installation working, make a ton of mistakes and fix all the errors that you're likely to get on your first try, you'll be extremely well prepared to handle whatever this crazy _Free Open Source Software_ world may throw your way. Just transitioning from having nothing to having a fully fledged Arch installation can be a big difference in the learning process of someone that's just starting in the Linux world.

Since I'm usually tasked with helping out students or friends that are planning of diving in into the Arch world for the first time, I've found myself fixing the same errors and explaining the same concepts over and over again. To be fair, I wasn't looking forward to doing it again, and since `Anything that you do more than twice has to be automated.(Adam Stone, CEO, D-Tools)` this left me with two choices:

- Start convincing people to use something that uses Arch, but is easier to install (like **Manjaro**). Frankly this goes against everything that I was trying to achieve by motivating people to install Arch, so this was a hard **no**.

* Making a walkthrough that explained the installation process in the simplest, most intuitive way I can, trying to show some useful tools, and solving some common problems that won't only help them during the installation process, but in their day-to-day use.
